Problem Statement:

Ayush is given a number ‘X’. He has been told that he has to find the first ‘X’ terms of the series 3 * ‘N’ + 2, which are not multiples of 4. Help Ayush to find it as he has not been able to answer.

Example: Given an ‘X’ = 4. The output array/list which must be passed to Ayush will be [ 5, 11, 14, 17 ].

//code
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
#include <vector>

vector < int > termsOfAP(int x) {
    // Write your code here.
    vector<int> v;
    int i=1;
    int count =0;
    while(count<x){
        int ans= 3*i+2;
        if(ans%4!=0){
            v.push_back(ans);
            i++;
            count++;
            
        }

        else i++;
    }
    return v;
}
